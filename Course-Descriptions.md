## Objectives

### Generals

It is desired that the student knows alternative techniques to
conventional statistics such as neural networks and is able to apply
them in real situations where statistical techniques could have
important limitations.

The course is designed for the student to master the concepts and
techniques associated with the various neuronal paradigms that are
studied, as well as to be able to use software for their application or
implement their own routines and use them. In this way, the theoretical
knowledge obtained is strengthened by the immediate application thereof
to real problems of interest.

The course emphasizes the various configurations of neural networks that
can be obtained and the various training algorithms that can be used,
according to the problem being attempted.

### Specifics

-   Understand and apply concepts and techniques of neural networks,
    appropriate selection of training and validation sets for them,
    detect patterns and make approaches using neural paradigms.
-   Write software for the application of the techniques studied to data
    sets in different areas, and interpret the results obtained within
    the framework of the problem being analyzed.

-   Usual logical connectors: disjunction, conjunction, negation,
    conditional and biconditional. (2 hours)
-   Modeling of propositional speeches: evaluations, truth table,
    feasibility, tautologies, logical consequence and logical
    equivalences. (6 hours)
-   Formal system of propositional logic: rules of inference, syntactic
    derivations, theorems. (2 hours)
-   Consistency, solidity and completeness of propositional logic. (2
    hours)
-   Variables and quantifiers: scope of quantifiers, variable ligatures,
    logical sentences. (2 hours)
-   Discourse modeling with predicate logic (first order). (4 hours)
-   Semantics of predicate logic: interpretations and models,
    satisfacibility, tautologies, logical consequence and logical
    equivalences. (6 hours)

## Objectives

### Generals

It is desired that the student knows alternative techniques to
conventional statistics such as neural networks and is able to apply
them in real situations where statistical techniques could have
important limitations.

The course is designed for the student to master the concepts and
techniques associated with the various neuronal paradigms that are
studied, as well as to be able to use software for their application or
implement their own routines and use them. In this way, the theoretical
knowledge obtained is strengthened by the immediate application thereof
to real problems of interest.

The course emphasizes the various configurations of neural networks that
can be obtained and the various training algorithms that can be used,
according to the problem being attempted.

## Objectives

### General

This course aims to develop competencies in students to develop a
software project, with a part-time dedication, during a trimester. In
the development of the mini software development project, the student
will have the opportunity to carry out activities of the various phases
of the software development cycle, in accordance with a work plan
proposed by a USB teacher. The student will cover some of the phases of
development, not necessarily all.

### Specifics

-   Establish a strategic planning of the processes related to the
    development of a software project.
-   Demonstrate in the professional practice of the mini software
    development project, the fundamental aspects around the conceptual,
    procedural and attitudinal competencies that a student must possess
    at the level of training that the software development process
    contemplates.
-   Systematically systematize the professional experience that
    constitutes the software development process with the fundamental
    guidelines established by the Teaching Coordination of the career.

## Topics

The Director of the Mini Project of Development of Sotfware will be a
professor of the USB who must write a plan of the work to be done, as
complete as a long internship plan, but whose development occurs
throughout the 12 weeks of a period of the USB.

The work plan must include a general objective (what is the product to
be built), specific objectives (how the general objective is subdivided
into smaller objectives in order to achieve the general one) and the
plan of activities to be carried out to achieve the objectives. It must
also be specified for how many students the Mini Software Development
Project is defined and what are the responsibilities of each student, if
it is offered for more than one student. Likewise, it must be specified
if the student must meet additional requirements to the requirements to
pursue the Mini Software Development Project, for example, having passed
a specialization chain or a particular subject may be additional
requirements.

The Teaching Coordination of the career must approve the work plan of
the Mini Software Development project before the student can take it.
And also verify that the student meets the requirements to take it. The
follow-up of the work will be in charge of the Director of the Mini
Project of Development of Sotfware and will be subject to the evaluation
standards of the Mini Software Development projects determined by the
Coordination, who is the unit in charge of planning, supervising,
advising and monitor compliance with the Mini Software Development
Project.

## Literature

According to the work plan and the area of application.

## Required to Complete

The Project must be evaluated by two Jurors selected by the
Coordination.

## Objectives

### General

This course aims to develop competencies in students to develop a
software project, with a part-time dedication, during a trimester. In
the development of the mini software development project, the student
will have the opportunity to carry out activities of the various phases
of the software development cycle, in accordance with a work plan
proposed by a USB teacher. The student will cover some of the phases of
development, not necessarily all.

### Specifics

-   Establish a strategic planning of the processes related to the
    development of a software project.
-   Demonstrate in the professional practice of the mini software
    development project, the fundamental aspects around the conceptual,
    procedural and attitudinal competencies that a student must possess
    at the level of training that the software development process
    contemplates.
-   Systematically systematize the professional experience that
    constitutes the software development process with the fundamental
    guidelines established by the Teaching Coordination of the career.

## Topics

The Director of the Mini Project of Development of Sotfware will be a
professor of the USB who must write a plan of the work to be done, as
complete as a long internship plan, but whose development occurs
throughout the 12 weeks of a period of the USB.

The work plan must include a general objective (what is the product to
be built), specific objectives (how the general objective is subdivided
into smaller objectives in order to achieve the general one) and the
plan of activities to be carried out to achieve the objectives. It must
also be specified for how many students the Mini Software Development
Project is defined and what are the responsibilities of each student, if
it is offered for more than one student. Likewise, it must be specified
if the student must meet additional requirements to the requirements to
pursue the Mini Software Development Project, for example, having passed
a specialization chain or a particular subject may be additional
requirements.

The Teaching Coordination of the career must approve the work plan of
the Mini Software Development project before the student can take it.
And also verify that the student meets the requirements to take it. The
follow-up of the work will be in charge of the Director of the Mini
Project of Development of Sotfware and will be subject to the evaluation
standards of the Mini Software Development projects determined by the
Coordination, who is the unit in charge of planning, supervising,
advising and monitor compliance with the Mini Software Development
Project.

## Literature

According to the work plan and the area of application.

## Required to Complete

The Project must be evaluated by two Jurors selected by the
Coordination.

## Validity

## Objectives

### General

This course aims to develop competencies in students to develop a
software project, with a part-time dedication, during a trimester. In
the development of the mini software development project, the student
will have the opportunity to carry out activities of the various phases
of the software development cycle, in accordance with a work plan
proposed by a USB teacher. The student will cover some of the phases of
development, not necessarily all.

### Specifics

-   Establish a strategic planning of the processes related to the
    development of a software project.
-   Demonstrate in the professional practice of the mini software
    development project, the fundamental aspects around the conceptual,
    procedural and attitudinal competencies that a student must possess
    at the level of training that the software development process
    contemplates.
-   Systematically systematize the professional experience that
    constitutes the software development process with the fundamental
    guidelines established by the Teaching Coordination of the career.

## Topics

The Director of the Mini Project of Development of Sotfware will be a
professor of the USB who must write a plan of the work to be done, as
complete as a long internship plan, but whose development occurs
throughout the 12 weeks of a period of the USB.

The work plan must include a general objective (what is the product to
be built), specific objectives (how the general objective is subdivided
into smaller objectives in order to achieve the general one) and the
plan of activities to be carried out to achieve the objectives. It must
also be specified for how many students the Mini Software Development
Project is defined and what are the responsibilities of each student, if
it is offered for more than one student. Likewise, it must be specified
if the student must meet additional requirements to the requirements to
pursue the Mini Software Development Project, for example, having passed
a specialization chain or a particular subject may be additional
requirements.

The Teaching Coordination of the career must approve the work plan of
the Mini Software Development project before the student can take it.
And also verify that the student meets the requirements to take it. The
follow-up of the work will be in charge of the Director of the Mini
Project of Development of Sotfware and will be subject to the evaluation
standards of the Mini Software Development projects determined by the
Coordination, who is the unit in charge of planning, supervising,
advising and monitor compliance with the Mini Software Development
Project.

## Literature

According to the work plan and the area of application.

## Required to Complete

The Project must be evaluated by two Jurors selected by the
Coordination.

## Validity

## Objectives

### General

This course aims to develop competencies in students to develop a
software project, with a part-time dedication, during a trimester. In
the development of the mini software development project, the student
will have the opportunity to carry out activities of the various phases
of the software development cycle, in accordance with a work plan
proposed by a USB teacher. The student will cover some of the phases of
development, not necessarily all.

### Specifics

-   Establish a strategic planning of the processes related to the
    development of a software project.
-   Demonstrate in the professional practice of the mini software
    development project, the fundamental aspects around the conceptual,
    procedural and attitudinal competencies that a student must possess
    at the level of training that the software development process
    contemplates.
-   Systematically systematize the professional experience that
    constitutes the software development process with the fundamental
    guidelines established by the Teaching Coordination of the career.

## Topics

The Director of the Mini Project of Development of Sotfware will be a
professor of the USB who must write a plan of the work to be done, as
complete as a long internship plan, but whose development occurs
throughout the 12 weeks of a period of the USB.

The work plan must include a general objective (what is the product to
be built), specific objectives (how the general objective is subdivided
into smaller objectives in order to achieve the general one) and the
plan of activities to be carried out to achieve the objectives. It must
also be specified for how many students the Mini Software Development
Project is defined and what are the responsibilities of each student, if
it is offered for more than one student. Likewise, it must be specified
if the student must meet additional requirements to the requirements to
pursue the Mini Software Development Project, for example, having passed
a specialization chain or a particular subject may be additional
requirements.

The Teaching Coordination of the career must approve the work plan of
the Mini Software Development project before the student can take it.
And also verify that the student meets the requirements to take it. The
follow-up of the work will be in charge of the Director of the Mini
Project of Development of Sotfware and will be subject to the evaluation
standards of the Mini Software Development projects determined by the
Coordination, who is the unit in charge of planning, supervising,
advising and monitor compliance with the Mini Software Development
Project.

## Literature

According to the work plan and the area of application.

## Required to Complete

The Project must be evaluated by two Jurors selected by the
Coordination.

## Validity
